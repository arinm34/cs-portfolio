# Arin Mahapatra — CS • Quant • SaaS Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my personal Computer Science portfolio — a collection of **quantitative finance projects**, **entrepreneurial ventures**, and **SaaS tools**.  
This repository showcases how I merge **algorithmic precision** with **founder-style adaptability** to build intelligent, scalable systems.

---

## 🧭 Overview

I design and implement systems that make data, markets, and behavior **interpretable, predictive, and actionable**.  
Each project integrates rigorous quantitative modeling with software systems thinking — reflecting my passion for both **finance** and **entrepreneurship**.

> 💡 *“I design systems that think like traders and learn like founders.”*

## 💼 Featured Projects

### 🧮 **Quant Research Toolkit**
A modular Python framework for portfolio analytics and strategy simulation.  
Implements backtesting, Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar ratio evaluation, and volatility modeling.

- Optimized for **low-latency execution**
- Configurable via `.yaml` strategy files
- Integrates **real-time market data feeds**

---

### ☁️ **Cloud9 Framework**
A personal SaaS for **emotional regulation, productivity, and self-optimization**.  
Gamifies habit tracking with journaling prompts, reflection modules, and progress visualization.

- Built with **Flask + React**
- Sentiment-based journaling analytics
- Mobile-first design roadmap using **Flutter**

---

### 💳 **PaymentTracker**
Automation suite that syncs **Google Forms → Google Sheets → Payment Validation**.  
Used for event and ticket management (Venmo + Zelle), built in Flask.

- REST-based pipeline for real-time updates  
- Auto-matching payments with unique identifiers  
- Ideal for student orgs and small business automation

## 🧪 Research Highlights

- **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering on Socioeconomic Indicators** — explored global patterns using 6-dimensional country vectors.  
- **Bayesian Language Model Classification** — probability-driven text language detection via multinomial modeling.  
- **Statistical Earnings Analysis (Stata + R)** — causal inference on education, income, and physical characteristics.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “I design systems that think like traders and learn like founders.”

This philosophy unites two disciplines:

- **Think like traders:** systems that are analytical, probabilistic, and driven by quantitative reasoning — adapting to uncertainty with precision.  
- **Learn like founders:** systems that evolve, iterate, and scale intelligently — learning from feedback and optimizing for growth.  

Together, they form a design mindset where software becomes **both adaptive and strategic**, bridging **quant research** and **startup innovation**.

## 🌍 Vision

Building **autonomous analytical systems** that transform how we interact with data, finance, and behavior —  
from algorithmic trading to human-centric SaaS.  
Each project here reflects a pursuit of **clarity, scalability, and measurable impact**.
